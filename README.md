# mock-market

A live-data stock-market app with real-time connections to APIs using a websocket server. As this is a school project, this is the audit video that we included for the simplicity of auditing process: https://youtu.be/pr5fL9-fStg.

# Technologies

**Backend**:

- Database: [Firestore Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- API with real-time data: [Finnhub](https://finnhub.io)
- API with historical data: [IEX Cloud](https://iexcloud.io)

**Frontend**:

# True Nerd Quest: Run Project Locally

- Proceed to the official [Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install), be ready to get your socks knocked off!
- Clone this repo to your machine.
- Run `flutter pub get`
- Run `main.dart` file with debugger (`ctrl+F5` in VSCode)
- Enjoy the app, go treat yourself to stocks you've never had the (fake) money for.
